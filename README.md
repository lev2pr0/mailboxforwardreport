# Mailbox Forward Report
## Purpose 

Microsoft‚Äôs current reporting on forwarding within organizations is reactive in nature. This reactive approach can lead to missed insider threats if not reported promptly. Additionally, manually creating reports via PowerShell can be time-consuming for security professionals.
<br></br>
To address these challenges, this script is designed to automate the process of generating a report on configured forwarding SMTP addresses on user or shared mailboxes.
<br></br>
For further reporting capabilities, refer to the [Public Distribution List](https://github.com/lev2pr0/publicDLreport) reporting feature, which allows security professionals to retrieve reports of all Distribution Lists open to external senders, enabling them to send mail to both internal and external recipients.
